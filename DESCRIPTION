Description: Resistance Genotyping tool for Human Cytomegalovirus sequencing data, a command line, website and database.
    The package includes
    Database : A comprehensive collation of literature material involving resistance phenotyping in HCMV. Location of mutants along with, fold change EC50 compared to susceptible or anecdotally "Resistance / Suceptible" are the data points. Qualifiers included are the type of experiemtn used to derive the information, and references for further reading.
    Shiny app: An intuitive way for scientists to call resitance on their data. Includes a clinical overview of the resistance phenotype, as well as some plots that may be of interest.
    Functions: Users happy running R code or using the terminal, can ofcourse interact with the packages functionality. This will return the resistance dataframes without any of the plotting or overviews. It's the same back end as the shiny app.
